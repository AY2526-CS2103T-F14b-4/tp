* Worldly is an app that helps exchange students build and sustain meaningful global connections while avoiding cultural missteps. 
* Centralising contacts and notes makes it easier to remember people and cultural nuances. 
* Unlike scattered chat apps, itâ€™s tailored for short but intense exchange journeys, ensuring friendships and networks last beyond the program.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
